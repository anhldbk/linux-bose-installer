Bose Installer
===========================


#### Overview

This repo contains scripts & sources to install necessary packages to get your Bose speakers work on Linux environments. Currently, only Fedora is supported

It costs me an arm and a leg to figure how to configure them the right way. I hope you found this repo useful. Happy listening!

#### Install

```sh
./install.sh
```

Finally, run `blueman` to see the magic.
